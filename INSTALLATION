Clint should build on most modern POSIX and BSD systems with windowing
interfaces.  It requires the following widely available libraries to be
installed and visible in respective pathes:
* Qt (version 5.4+)
* Boost (version 1.59+)
* GMP (version 6.0+)

It must be compiled with C++14 support (use clang-3.5+ or GCC 4.9+).

It also requires *development* versions of the following polyhedral framework
libraries:
* isl
* OpenScop
* CLooG
* Clan
* Candl
* Clay
* Chlore


Please only use the versions provided via Git submodules mechanism.  Call

git submodule init
git submodule update

Build each submodule separately and install them (you might want to install
them into a separate directory so that they do not interfere with system
versions, isl and CLooG may be installed system-wide together with GCC or LLVM).


Build Clint with CMake

mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make

Make sure all libraries are visible to CMake, e.g. by using
-DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=... option.

Clint compiles to a single executable file.  Ensure dynamic library loader path
points to the just installed development versions of the polyhedral libraries
before running it.


This procedure is intentionally long for the development version of Clint and
will be automated for the stable release version.
